   - **Sends acceptance email via SendGrid** ðŸ“§

3. **Student receives email** â†’ Professional HTML email with:
   - Congratulations message
   - Poster title
   - Payment instructions
   - Direct payment link button

4. **Student sees in profile** â†’ "Payment Pending" badge with "Complete Payment" button

5. **Student completes Stripe payment** â†’ Redirected to: https://buy.stripe.com/cNi6oJdBXd8j4COeMqgrS00

6. **Admin marks as paid** â†’ Clicks "Mark as Paid" button in admin panel

7. **Poster goes live** â†’ Visible on public network
