# 🎉 Stripe Payment Integration - READY TO PUSH

## ✅ What's Included

### Payment Flow (WITHOUT Email Automation):

1. **Student submits poster** → Free submission
2. **Admin approves poster** → Backend sets payment_status="pending" and payment_link
3. **Admin manually emails student** → Uses template in MANUAL_EMAIL_GUIDE.md
4. **Student sees payment link in profile** → "Payment Pending" badge with button
5. **Student completes Stripe payment** → Redirected to: https://buy.stripe.com/cNi6oJdBXd8j4COeMqgrS00
6. **Admin marks as paid** → Clicks "Mark as Paid" in admin panel
7. **Poster goes live** → Visible on public network

## 🔧 Database Migration (Optional)

If you have existing approved posters, they won't be visible publicly because they don't have payment_status.

**Quick Fix:**
Use MongoDB Compass or command line to update existing posters:

```javascript
// Set all current approved posters to completed payment
db.poster_submissions.updateMany(
  {
    status: "approved",
    payment_status: { $exists: false }
  },
  {
    $set: {
      payment_status: "completed",
      payment_completed_at: null,
      payment_link: null
    }
  }
)
```
