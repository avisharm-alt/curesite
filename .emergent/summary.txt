The AI engineer successfully transitioned the CURE application from a social network to an academic publishing platform, CURE Journal. Key accomplishments include integrating journal article management into the Admin Panel, developing a dedicated article submission page with PDF upload functionality, and robust backend endpoints for article submission, review, and payment. User feedback drove iterative UI/UX changes, including the removal of social features and an elegant dark theme. Critical bug fixes addressed Stripe checkout parameter issues and the Stripe webhook logic, ensuring articles correctly appear after successful payment. The engineer also implemented an Read Abstract modal for articles and admin deletion capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The initial product, CURE Social, was a verified academic network with social features, academic circles, poster integration, and a professor network. This involved a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend. Extensive UI/UX refinements were made based on user feedback, including authentication fixes, poster viewing, and a Sequoia Capital-inspired dark theme.

A significant pivot transformed CURE into an academic publishing platform, removing all social features and introducing CURE Journal for abstracts and projects. This required a new backend for submissions, an admin review system for article management (ensuring private visibility until published and paid), and a refined homepage displaying partner university crests. The journal now requires a complete payment and acceptance system, similar to the poster journal, with the ability to upload PDF documents, a functional Read Abstract button, and admin functionality to delete submissions.

<current_work>
The immediate preceding work involved fixing a critical bug where journal articles, after successful payment, were not appearing on the site. The AI engineer diagnosed this as an issue within the Stripe webhook handler in . Specifically, the  model only contained a  field, while the webhook logic was incorrectly attempting to access generic  and  fields. The webhook logic was modified to correctly use the existing  field for identifying the payment type and associated article, ensuring that the  for journal articles is accurately updated to completed upon a successful webhook event. This fix was verified by the backend testing agent.
