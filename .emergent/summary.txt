The previous AI engineer successfully launched CURE Social, iteratively refining its UI/UX and fixing bugs like poster viewing. Subsequent user feedback led to numerous design iterations for the onboarding page and overall site aesthetic, culminating in a Sequoia Capital-inspired dark theme that was well-received. A set of CURE logos was also generated. A significant shift occurred when the user requested the removal of all social features, pivoting CURE to an academic publishing platform with a new CURE Journal for abstracts. This involved backend model/endpoint creation and frontend integration. Concurrently, the homepage was redesigned to feature partner university crests. The current task is to complete the backend and frontend for the CURE Journal, specifically by integrating article management into the Admin Panel.

The initial vision was CURE Social, a verified, research-first academic network with core social features (posts, comments, likes, follows, feeds), academic circles, poster integration, and a professor network. This necessitated a FastAPI backend with MongoDB collections for social data and a React frontend with dedicated social components. Initial MVP also included user migration with roles, an onboarding flow, search, and in-app notifications.
Extensive user feedback drove numerous UI/UX improvements, including layout, text visibility, consistent aesthetic matching (e.g., green/white to dark theme, then clean, modern), and an onboarding flow with dynamic data. Critical bug fixes included social feed authentication and persistent poster viewing issues.
A major pivot redirected the project to focus on CURE as an academic publishing platform. This involved completely removing all social features and introducing CURE Journal for abstracts and projects, independent of the poster journal. This new journal requires its own submission process, backend infrastructure, and an admin review system to manage articles, ensuring those under review are not publicly visible. The main website's aesthetic was also refined to display partner university crests with a professional, integrated design.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The central FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance:** Houses all backend models, API endpoints, and business logic.
    -   **Changes:** Previously integrated social models/APIs. Recently, new Pydantic models (, , ) and CRUD API endpoints (for submission, review, feed, payment) for the CURE Journal were added. The Stripe webhook handler was also extended to cover journal article payments.
-   ****: Main React application file.
    -   **Importance:** Manages global routing, navigation, and top-level layout.
    -   **Changes:** Removed social-related routes and the  component. Added a new  route for the .
-   ****: Global CSS file.
    -   **Importance:** Defines application-wide styling.
    -   **Changes:** Underwent multiple design overhauls, from enhanced professional to Sequoia Capital-inspired dark theme. Styling was added for the new partner universities section, including complex layouts, hover effects, and grayscale-to-color transitions for crests. Styles for  were also introduced.
-   ****: The main landing page.
    -   **Importance:** Presents the initial user experience and key information.
    -   **Changes:** Redesigned to replace a pipette logo with a Partner Universities section. This evolved through several iterations: a simple list, then logos in dark cards, then integrated crests, finally styled with a matte finish, clear cross-pattern dividing lines, and consistent sizing.
-   ****: User onboarding flow.
    -   **Importance:** Guides new users through initial profile setup.
    -   **Changes:** Experienced several UI design changes based on user feedback (professional, minimalist, ultra-minimalist, Sequoia-inspired, back to a cleaner professional look).
-   ****: Modal for viewing academic posters.
    -   **Importance:** Displays poster content.
    -   **Changes:** Fixed to correctly use the backend  endpoint for reliable poster viewing.
-   ****: New page for CURE Journal articles.
    -   **Importance:** Displays and manages academic projects/abstracts.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch with initial UI and logic to fetch published journal articles from the backend. Filters for different article statuses were removed as only published ones are shown publicly.
-   ****: A utility HTML file.
    -   **Importance:** Provides a visual preview and download links for generated SVG logos.
    -   **Changes:** Created to facilitate user review of generated logos.
-   ****: Administrative interface.
    -   **Importance:** Allows administrators to manage content, including posters and now, journal articles.
    -   **Changes:** Currently being updated to integrate the CURE Journal. This includes adding new state for journal articles, implementing data fetching, creating an Articles tab in the navigation, and developing handler functions for article review. The  component is actively under construction.

<current_work>
The current work focuses on integrating the CURE Journal functionality into the administrative interface, specifically within . The AI engineer has progressed significantly by:
1.  **Adding new state variables**: , , and  have been introduced to manage the state of journal article data within the admin panel.
2.  **Implementing data fetching logic**: A  function has been created to retrieve journal articles from the new backend endpoint ().
3.  **Updating UI navigation**: A new Articles tab has been added to the admin panel's navigation, allowing administrators to switch to journal article management.
4.  **Creating handler functions**: Essential functions such as , , and  have been defined to process administrative actions on journal articles.
The immediate next step, and where the trajectory leaves off, is the creation of the  component within . This component is intended to display the list of journal articles along with their status and payment details, providing the UI for the previously defined handler functions. The  is being used as a reference for its structure and functionality.
